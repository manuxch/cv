	abstract = "A simplified version of the so-called Yukagua model of water, proposed and studied via Monte Carlo simulations elsewhere by two of the authors [Physica A 265, 396 (1999)], is considered. The model includes dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar short-range interactions of tetrahedral symmetry that mimic hydrogen bonds, but it differs from the original Yukagua model in that dipolar and quadrupolar terms are not coupled. For this model we solve, using Baxter-Wertheim factorization technique, the Ornstein-Zernike relation for the molecular pair correlation functions closed by generalized mean spherical closures. From the molecular correlations we derive the atom-atom (oxygen-oxygen, oxygen-hydrogen, and hydrogen-hydrogen) pair correlations. We compare our results with those obtained from diffraction experiments and also from other theoretical treatments available in the recent literature including a modified version of the hypernetted chain integral equation for the SPC/E water model and also ab initio simulations of Car-Parrinello type.",

Chothia's linear relation between the accessible surface area and the hydrophobicity is shown. The line obtained has a slope equivalent to 49 cal mol^(-1) A^(-2). The radial distribution of solvent molecules around the amino acids residues is considered, and a comparison is made of the number of hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules in the presence and in the absence, respectively, of the amino acids.

Chemical clusters are defined as sets of particles connected through particle-particle bonds that last for a given time $\tau$. Physical clusters are sets of particles that remain close together at every instant for a given period of time $\tau$. By using molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones system we obtain the percolation loci at different values of $\tau$ as the lines in the temperature-density plane at which the system presents a spanning cluster in 50\% of the configurations. We find that the percolation loci for chemical clusters shifts rapidly toward high densities as $\tau$ is increased. For moderate values of tau this line converges to the low-density branch of the liquid-solid coexistence curve. This implies that no stable chemical clusters can be found in the fluid phase. In contrast, the percolation loci for physical clusters tend to a limiting line, as $\tau$ tends to infinity, which is far from the liquid-solid transition line.",

	abstract = "We study the dynamical behavior of a single degree of freedom mechanical system with a particle damper. The particle (granular) damping was optimized for the primary system operating condition by using an appropriate gap size for a prismatic enclosure. The particles absorb the kinetic energy of the vibrating structure and convert it into heat through the inelastic collisions and friction. This results in a highly nonlinear mechanical system. Considering linear signal analysis, state space reconstruction, Poincar{\'e} sections and the determination of maximal Lyapunov exponents, the motion of the granular system inside the enclosure is characterized for a wide frequency range. With the excitation frequency as control parameter, either regular or chaotic motion of the granular bed is found and the influence on the damping is analyzed.",

Models with ellipses that had an aspect ratio of a/b\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1.5 showed relatively good agreement when compared with realistic models of bone tissue.

	abstract = "A particle damper (PD) is a device that can attenuate mechanical vibrations thanks to the dissipative collisions between grains contained in a cavity attached to the vibrating structure. It has been recently suggested that, under working conditions in which the damping is optimal, the PD has a universal response in the sense that the specific dissipative properties of the grains cease to be important for the design of the device. We present evidence from simulations of PDs containing grains of different sizes, shapes and restitution coefficients, that the universal response is also valid when fragmentation of the grains occurs (generally due to intensive operation of the PD). In contrast, the welding of grains (caused by operation under high temperatures) can take the PD out of the universal response and deteriorate the attenuation. Interestingly, we observed that even at working conditions off the optimal damping, the shape of the grains remains unimportant for the response of the PD.",

It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an atom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original ideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the chronological order of appearance of the amino acids along the evolution as inferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical speculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based mathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central object in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid an integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is preserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of amino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we propose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three dimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental one stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical representation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken into account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the genetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the close relationship between quaternions and rotations.",

  abstract={We study the discharge of a two-dimensional silo through small openings via discrete element simulations. We consider the effect of the shape of the grains on the clogging of the flow, focusing on regular polygons and disks. We show that the clogging probability presents a non-linear response as a function of the number of vertexes of the polygons. Also, the clogging probability is strongly dependent on the protocol used to trigger the flow after each clog. We found that the size and shape of the blocking arches display a much larger variability for some polygons, particularly for squares, than for disks.}

abstract = "A robust, simple and fast procedure for the calculation of uncertainties in static relative permittivity (εs) computed via molecular dynamics (MD) is proposed. It arises as a direct application of well founded statistical methods for auto-correlated variables. Also, in order to deal with the lack of experimental data on εs and relaxation times at different temperatures, a method for their prediction is suggested. This method requires one experimental value and at least two MD simulations. In the case of relaxation times, a theoretical justification is provided."

	abstract = {The bone quality is associated with changes in its dielectric properties (permittivity and conductivity). The feasibility of detecting changes in these properties was evaluated by using a tomographic array of 16 monopole antennas with z-polarized microwaves at 1.3 GHz. The direct electromagnetic problem was solved computationally with the finite–difference–time–domain (FDTD) method. Local and global sensitivity analyses were implemented for identifying the parameters that most affect the detection. Magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficient of the antennas were evaluated separately. It was observed that the direct problem is highly sensitive to the dielectric properties of the tissues surrounding the calcaneus and to those of the calcaneus itself. Global and local sensitivity methods have shown evidence for feasible detection of variations in dielectric properties of the bone supporting the simplification of considering only two homogeneous media (calcaneus and surrounding tissue).}
